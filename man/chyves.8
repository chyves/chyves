.SH "DESCRIPTION"
chyves(8) relies on the FreeBSD hypervisor bhyve(8), zfs(8), nmdm(4), Bourne shell sh(1), and cu(1) to start and manage type 2 virtualized guests\. Optionally grub2\-bhyve and tmux(1) can be used to expand the capabilities of chyves\. chyves uses configuration files, ZFS filesystem datasets and volumes to store guest, chyves settings, and chyves resources in an organized hierarchy\. bhyve uses virtio drivers built into the GENERIC kernel for network virtualization\. The virtio drivers are used to paravirtualize I/O for disk and network access\.
.
.P
For networking, a guest is presented a PCI Ethernet device through the use of virtio(4)\. On FreeBSD guests this means the vtnet(4) driver is used\. After a certain commit, Intel e1000 emulation was added as an alternative to virtio\-net\. See guest property \'bhyve_net_type\' for details\. In either case, host network communication is through a tap(3) or vale(4) interface to the guest\.
.
.P
For storage, guests are provided block storage device(s) via ZFS volumes from the host by default\. ZFS datasets are used to organize these block devices and other resources in a hierarchical structure\. See \fIZFS\fR section for more information\.
.
.P
Multi\-guest [MG] support is the ability to specify multiple guest names that are comma separate for a sub\-command\. Not all sub\-commands have this functionality but the ones that do, allow for rapid execution of the same command over many guests, this can be incredibly helpful for a fleet of VMs\. Commands in the synopsis above with the "\fIguest\fR|MG" syntax indicate compatibility with multi\-guest\. Using the word \'all\' instead of \fIguest\fR will specify all active guests on the system for supported commands\.
.
.SH "DEPENDENCIES"
bhyve(8) and chyves(8) will run on a base FreeBSD installation\. However the required kernel modules are not loaded by default on FreeBSD\. By default \fBchyves\fR will attempt to load the required kernel modules when needed\. There are also certain non\-FreeBSD\-base binaries that enhance \fBchyves\fR capabilities\. These binaries are checked for and in certain cases, exits if the required component is not detected\.
.
.P
At least one ZFS pool is required\. All data is stored on one or many ZFS pools and depends on ZFS volumes for guest\'s disks backing\. \fBchyves\fR capitalizes on multi\-pool configurations\. Multiple pool configurations are common in FreeNAS deployments, separated storage types (eg: SSD, HD, NVMe), and OS plus storage configurations\.

.SS "Hardware dependencies:"
bhyve(8) is dependent on hardware virtualization CPU features\. One feature is called Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), also known as nested paging\. Intel\'s implementation is called Extended Page Tables (EPT) and AMD\'s implementation is called Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI)\. This CPU feature is referenced as \'POPCNT\' in dmesg(8) under \'Features2:\' line\.
.
.P
There is an early series of CPUs from Intel (Xeon 5500) that has most of the necessary virtualization capabilities but lack a feature Intel later implemented called unrestricted guest (\'\fBUG\fR\' in dmesg(8) under "VT\-x:")\. Without this feature bhyve is limited to FreeBSD guests with only one CPU core\. AMD has the \'\fBUG\fR\' functionality in all of it\'s RVI implementations\.
.
.P
PCI Pass\-through support is also provided through another sub\-set of hardware virtualization CPU features called I/O MMU virtualization\. Intel calls their implementation \'\fBVT\-d\fR\' and AMD calls their implementation \'\fBAMD\-Vi\fR\'\. See the \fBpcidev_{n}\fR property under \fIGuest Properties\fR section for instructions on attaching PCI pass\-through devices\. A check is ran before starting a guest that has PCI pass\-through devices configured and will not start the guest if the host does not have the necessary CPU feature\.
.
.SH "ZFS"
As mentioned in the \fIDEPENDENCIES\fR section above, there is a hard dependency on ZFS and as such requires at least one ZFS pool\. There are many features that rely on ZFS, such as cloning\. The ISO, UEFI firmware, and guest resources and properties are stored within ZFS datasets\.
.
.P
Single and multiple ZFS pools are supported, there is no loss in functionality for either\. \fBchyves\fR datasets get mounted to \'/chyves/\fIpool\fR\'\. The \'/chyves\' directory itself is stored on \'/\' and does not belong to any of the chyves datasets\. The first pool is assigned the primary pool role but this can be changed afterwards\. The primary pool is the only pool containing the UEFI Firmware resources, ISO resources, the global properties, and the comprehensive logs\.
.
.P
See \fIDATASET SUB\-COMMANDS\fR section below for managing the \fBchyves\fR datasets\.

.SS "GUEST STORAGE"
By default, chyves uses ZFS volumes as guest storage backing\. Each volume is named disk{n} and is attached to the guest via an emulated AHCI controller\. On all hosts, 8 ahci\-hd devices are supported per PCI slot\. On certain hosts, up to 32 ahci devices can be attached per PCI slot\. See global property \'consolidate_bhyve_pci_devices\' for details\.
.
.P
There is limited support for raw file backed guest storage\. This is a manual process and there are not any chyves commands that create, modify, or delete these raw image files\. \fBAll files\fR in the \'img/\' folder and child folders are attached to the guest on start\. To have independent snapshots for each raw image, create a child datasets under \fB<pool>/chyves/guests/<guest>/img\fR, this has an advantage over ZFS volumes as there is no refreservation cost associated with the snapshots\. The command \fBchyves info\fR reports the raw image files and size\. To create a sparse raw image run:
.
.P
\fBtruncate \-s 16G /chyves/<pool>/guests/<guest>/img/<image\-name>\fR
.
.SH "LOGS"
All logs entries are stored on the primary pool under \fB/chyves/<primary\-pool>/chyves/logs\fR with the dataset\'s compression turned on\. The file are separated on a monthly basis using a \fBYYYYMM\.log\fR file name\. The log entries use the ISO 8601 date format for monitoring tools\. There is a separate log file on a per guest basis, however at this time not all guest events are recorded to this file, however these events \fIare\fR recorded in the global logs regardless\.

The second field is the \'stdout_level\', \'2\' in the example above\. The third field is the log event, \'Mimicking tap50 interface for g10\.\' in the example above\. See the \fIGlobal Configuration Properties\fR section below for more information on what \'stdout_level\' does\.
.
.SH "NETWORK"
The network mode is set by the global setting \'\fBnetwork_design_mode\fR\' and determines how chyves handles network devices for the guests\. The two modes are \'\fBauto\fR\' and \'\fBsystem\fR\', both modes are discussed below\.
.
.P
VALE support is experimentally provided as a proof of concept\. VALE support is not widely implemented and is feature limited at it\'s current development stage\. To use VALE requires that \'device netmap\' be compiled into the kernel and that \'vale\-ctl\' be compiled from \'/usr/src/tools/tools/netmap\' and moved to $PATH directory\. VALE natively support em(4), igb(4), ixgbe(4), and re(4)\. Other NICs must use emulation which may reduce performance\. See netmap(4) for more information\. VALE interfaces are added to a guest the same way a tap interface is added using: \'\fBchyves network add vale{n}[:{p}]\fR\' where {n} is the vale switch you want to use and optionally :{p} specifies the port on that switch\. Specifying a port is not recommended\. VALE interfaces are clever in that the interface is commonly shared between other guests connecting to that \'virtual\' VALE switch\. Two guests using \'vale0\' will be connected to the same virtual switch\.
.
.P
Hosts after a certain commit support Intel e1000 emulation as an alternative to using virtio\-net\. This can be utilized by setting \'bhyve_net_type\' to \'e1000\', see guest property for details\.
.
.SS "AUTO DESIGN NETWORK MODE"
By default, chyves is configured to manage the complete network design layout\. chyves keeps track of which physical, tap, and vlan interfaces are associated with which bridges, and which tap and VALE interfaces are associated with which guests\. Upon starting a guest these designs are checked, verified, and then created if not existing\. To manage the network design using this method, use the \'chyves network\' commands to create the associations and \'chyves list bridges\' for an overview\.
.
.P
On a fresh simple installation, the only command needed is \'chyves network bridge0 attach em0\'\. This tells chyves to associate the interface \'em0\' with the default bridge\. To change the default bridge, the command would be \'chyves network bridge64 default\' to set \'bridge64\' as the default\. All tap interfaces created for guests are then associated with the bridge set in defaults\.
.
.P
As indicated above, tap interfaces are attached to a bridge, which optionally can be attached to a physical or vlan interface\. If the bridge is not associated with a physical or vlan interface, the bridge must be put into \'private\' mode\. This is done by running \'chyves network bridge64 private\'\. A private bridge allows sensitive traffic to transverse the bridge without the possibility of traffic being monitored from an outside network\. A private bridge can also use pf(4) for NAT capabilities but this is not built into chyves\.
.
.SS "SYSTEM DESIGN NETWORK MODE"
The \'system\' mode assumes the user will correctly create and configure all devices on the host system, including the tap devices\. No checks are ran to test connectivity and chyves simply attaches tap or VALE interfaces to the guest as configured in the \'net_ifaces\' property\.
.
.P
Converting from \'system\' to \'auto\' will not automatically start to work\. Each device will need to be manually associated with each other\.
.
.SH "PROPERTIES"
There are four types of chyves properties: global configuration properties, pool properties, per\-guest properties, and default guest properties\. Each is stored in a file in the chyves dataset hierarchy\. \fBIt is not recommended to directly edit the \'*\.cfg\' files, this is because there are no filters to stop typos, warn for incorrect property names, or invalid values\.\fR The filter is only applied when running the \'chyves \fIguest\fR set\' command and not rechecked when pulling the values from the files\.
.
.P
Also certain actions are triggered when setting certain properties\. For example, setting the \'\fBtemplate\fR\' guest property will set or unset the \fIreadonly\fR flag on the ZFS dataset\.

The pool configuration is stored in a file at \'/chyves/\fIpool\fR/\.config/pool\.cfg\'\. On the primary pool there is also a file in the same directory called \'global\.cfg\', this contains the global settings for chyves\.

.P
The \'dataset_role\' setting is used to store the role of that pool containing the chyves datasets\. Valid values are primary, secondary, and offline\. Only one \'primary\' dataset can be configured per system\. The primary dataset is the only dataset that contains the ISO and firmware resources\. Only the primary pool has guest defaults configuration file\. These defaults are referenced when setting properties for new guests\. The primary pool is also where new guests are created when the [\fIpool\fR] argument is not declared with \'chyves create\' command\. All other active pools are set to the "secondary" role\. Pools set to the \'offline\' role are left untouched and is a good role to put a local replicated backup\. The primary pool is critical to the operation of chyves, without a primary pool set, only the \'dataset\' sub\-command are permitted to run\. The first pool setup on the system is the primary pool\. This can be changed later with \'chyves dataset \fIpool\fR promote\'\.

.SS "Pool Properties"
These properties keeps track of the version of the dataset and the role\. With multiple pools, defined per\-pool roles are necessary\. This is defined through the use of a dataset called \'\fIpool\fR/chyves/\.config\' where the pool specific properties (\fBpool\.cfg\fR) are stored\.

Any non\-zero number tells chyves to start the guest upon host boot when the \'chyves_enable=YES\' directive is used in \'/etc/rc\.conf\'\. The integer represents the boot priority where the highest numbered guest is started first\. Using \'0\' disables starting on host boot\. If multiple guest share the same priority number, then those guests are started alphabetically\.

.
.IP
Prior to starting and/or rebooting, a guest can be reverted to a previous snapshot state\. This is helpful for guests that get modified outside of specification such as frequently compromised web server or VDI instances\. Setting to \'start\' only reverts the guest when starting the guest, \'reboot\' only on reboots, \'both\' for both starts and restarts, and \'off\' to disable this feature on the guest\.

.SH "TMUX SUPPORT"
Utilization of tmux is provided under the command \'chyves \fIguest\fR console tmux\'\.
.
.P
chyves utilizes tmux by creating a session called "chyves", then creates a window named after the guest, then splits that window into two panes\. The left pane is used to manage the guest and the right pane is the serial console for the guest\. If a window named after the guest already exists, then the command is inserted into the active pane for that guest window and then the session is joined or rather \'attached\' in tmux\'s parlance\. Each additional guest has a window created under the same \'chyves\' named session\. See tmux(1) for full details on use\.
.
.P
To use a command for tmux, enter: \'Ctrl + b (release\-keys) \fIcommand\fR\'\. Where Ctrl + b is the modifier, (release\-keys) is literally releasing the Ctrl and b keys, and \fIcommand\fR is the case sensitive letter or command to type in\. Sometimes this is written as \'C\-m\' where \'m\' means modifier\. In this man page, the abbreviated syntax used is \'C\-b\'\. Below are necessary tmux commands for basic use with chyves:

.SH "UEFI SUPPORT"
Support to boot guests via UEFI is provided through the use of a bootrom firmware set with the \'uefi_firmware\' property\. This boot method is set by changing the \'loader\' property to \'uefi\'\. When this is done for the first time on a guest, many other guest UEFI properties are populated\.

Graphical console support is provided via UEFI GOP as of May 2016, this replaces the serial interface\. Support is provided as a technical preview as there are still sharp edges\. Know issues: partial VNC client support and mouse mapping issues when \'uefi_vnc_mouse_type\' property set to \'ps2\'\. The following is required for graphical console use: the property \'uefi_console_output\' must be set to \'vnc\' on the guest, a host on 11\-BETA1, and the UEFI firmware \'BHYVE_UEFI_20160526\.fd\', and a VNC client\.

.SS "NETWORK SUB\-COMMANDS"
When global property \'network_design_mode\' is set to \'auto\', these commands are used to create and manage network design by storing properties about associate network devices and creates bridge and tap interfaces\. The sub\-commands below store properties that are referenced and later used to verify and (re)created the network design when starting a guest\. The host still requires a user set configuration of the vlan and physical interfaces\. chyves will handle creating and associating the tap interfaces with the appropriate bridge interfaces and also attaching those configured vlan and physical interfaces to the bridges while starting a guest\. Multiple bridges and taps per guest is supported\. See \fINETWORK\fR section above\.
